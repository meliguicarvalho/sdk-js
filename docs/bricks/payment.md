## Available Flows

The Payment Brick supports two distinct flows, each designed for specific user scenarios:

### üîì [Guest Flow](./payment-guest.md)

**For unauthenticated users who need to provide complete payment information**

The Guest Flow is designed for users who are not logged into a Mercado Pago account. This flow offers maximum flexibility and extensive customization options.

**Key Features:**

- Full payment method configuration (credit/debit cards, tickets, bank transfers, ATM, etc.)
- Complete payer information collection
- Extensive customization options for payment methods and UI
- Support for saved cards via Customer ID
- Dynamic amount updates with the `update()` method
- Payment method availability varies by country

**Best for:** E-commerce checkouts, one-time payments, new user registrations

### üîê [Supertoken Flow](./payment-supertoken.md)

**For authenticated users leveraging saved payment methods**

The Supertoken Flow provides a streamlined experience for users who are already logged into their Mercado Pago account, utilizing their saved payment methods and account information.

**Key Features:**

- Streamlined checkout with saved payment methods
- Automatic access to user's account money
- Reduced form fields and faster completion
- Enhanced security with authentication token
- Limited but focused customization options
- No dynamic updates (managed through account context)

**Best for:** Returning customers, subscription payments, marketplace integrations with user accounts

## Flow Selection

The brick automatically determines which flow to use based on the presence of the `supertoken` property in the initialization settings:

```js
// Guest Flow - no supertoken provided
mp.bricks().create('payment', 'container', {
  initialization: {
    amount: 10000,
    // ... other guest flow settings
  },
  // ...
});

// Supertoken Flow - supertoken provided
mp.bricks().create('payment', 'container', {
  initialization: {
    supertoken: '<USER_SUPERTOKEN>',
    // ... other supertoken flow settings
  },
  // ...
});
```
